    <h2>If I could see through walls, I could see you're fakin'
        If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
        Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
        We didn't give a fuck back then
        I ain't a kid no more
        We'll never be those kids again
        We'd drive to Syd's
        Had the X6 back then, back then
        No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
        Everything sucked back then, we were friends

    <p>A wiki (/ˈwɪki/ ⓘ WICK-ee) is a form of hypertext publication on the internet which is collaboratively edited and managed by its audience directly through a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages that can either be edited by the public or limited to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base. Its name derives from the first user-editable website called "WikiWikiWeb"; "wiki" (pronounced [wiki][note 1]) is a Hawaiian word meaning "quick".[1][2][3][4]
Wikis are powered by wiki software, also known as wiki engines. Being a form of content management system, these differ from other web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader. Wikis have little inherent structure, allowing one to emerge according to the needs of the users.[5] Wiki engines usually allow content to be written using a lightweight markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor.[6] There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems.</p>
